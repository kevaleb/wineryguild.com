	<h3>Perfect! We'll mail your card to you as soon as possible.</h3>
	<h1>Next.. You need to check your email inbox.</h1>
	<br /><br />
	<p>
		We've sent you a welcome email with a "Digital Guild Card" which you can use to get all the same benefits of a physical card (but without waiting for the snail mail to arrive. )
		<br /><br />
		Look for an email from <strong>kevin@wineryguild.com</strong> that has your proof of membership and directions on how to use it. 
		<br /><br />
		See you in your inbox. =)
