			<h2>Tell Your Story</h2>
			<p>We start with a simple “over the phone” interview about  you, your winery and the region you're in. Our primary goal is to uncover your story and highlight the things that set you apart from other wineries. It usually only takes 15-30 minutes.</p>

			<h2>Tell Your Story</h2>
			<p>We start with a simple “over the phone” interview about  you, your winery and the region you're in. Our primary goal is to uncover your story and highlight the things that set you apart from other wineries. It usually only takes 15-30 minutes.<br /><br />We record the interview, cut out any awkward pauses and piece everything together to form a complete story. Then using images and footage we get from you (or take ourselves) along with a little animation magic we bring your story to life in a awesome video, which we’ll use as an episode for our show (and you can use however you’d like). =)</p>

			<h2>Spread The Word</h2>
			<p>Once we're finished producing an episode it’s time for the fun part, sharing your story with everyone/anyone who will listen.  
			<br /><br />
			We start by creating a search engine optimized profile for your winery. Because when someone searches for wineries in your area we want your video to be the first thing they see. 
			<br /><br />
			Then we start sharing interesting captions from your interview across our social networks to entice new viewers to come hear your story. (we even run a little paid advertising on Google, Facebook, etc.) to get in front of as many wine lovers in your area as possible.</p>

			<h2>Sell More Wine</h2>
			<p>
				The final goal isn't just about telling people your story or even getting them to visit your winery... we want to help you sell more wine. 
				<br /><br /> 
				This is a community of people who appreciate great wine and really care about where it comes from. We want to make it easy for them to try your wine, even if they aren't close enough to come visit your in person.</p>
