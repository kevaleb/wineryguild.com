At Granite Lion Cellars, we believe in the goodness of life. Abundant, beautiful, and joyful, the vineyard expresses an idea that the best things in life are simple and honest. If there is truth in wine, it comes from the plain transition of fruit and soil and sun into a blend of art and fate.

Granite Lion Cellars begins with the best vine stock and cherishes the distinctive characteristics that make every variety unique because we understand that all we take through life is ourselves. A young winery, Granite Lion Vineyards presents a rich and distinctive taste intrinsic to the passion of youth.

And, young at heart, we believe doing everything with all our soul is the best way to reflect the beauty of life.
