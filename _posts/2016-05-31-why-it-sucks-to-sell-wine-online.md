In most industries getting your shop up and running online is super easy. Thanks to tools like squarespace, wix & worpdress&nbsp; (not to mention all the third party shopping carts out there) you can be ready to take orders in just a few minutes.

When it comes to selling wine online there are some really stringent shipping laws that have to be taken into account. There are states, counties and even zip codes that just don’t allow you to send wine there, and if you do, you instantly become a felon.&nbsp; (goodbye dreams of somedy becoming president.)

So you might say that staying in compliance with these laws is a pretty big deal.&nbsp;

The bad news is…

## There are very few tools with the ability to prohibit shipping to certain locations.

So in a world where putting up a website and selling directly to customers should be the easiest thing we do. We find ourselves with only a few overly complex, outdated & expensive options to choose from.

Which, of course, means you end up spending a bunch of money on web developers to do what the rest of the world is doing with just a few clicks of their mouse.

The good news is...

## We’ve developed our own little solution for getting wine shops up and running fast.

It’s not perfect, yet (It still requires a developer)... but it’s a simple, cost effective & compliant way to sell your wine online.

You can even use it to sell in your tasting room or manage your wine club. Which is cool and all, but...

There’s a&nbsp;bigger problem that needs to be addressed...

## Selling wine online is NOT as simple as throwing up a website & waiting for orders to roll in.&nbsp;

The truth is… getting your website up and running is only like 10% of the work. It’s the equivalent of loading your backpack before the long hard climb up a mountain.&nbsp;

You still have to get out there, let people know you exist, give them a good enough reason to come visit and then talk them into spending their hard earned money on some wine that they’ve probably never tasted.

These are just a few of the ways you can promote your wine online, and that’s kind of the problem… Making all of this happen isn’t easy! It’s expensive, time consuming and requires a lot of specialised knowledge and skill.

That’s where the Winery Guild comes in...
